The code analyzes the duration of the movies in above dataset. It first calculates the average duration of movies, finding the mean duration. 
This gives us a sense of the typical length of movies in the dataset. 
The next step is to visualize the distribution of movie durations using a density plot. 
The plot helps us see how movie durations are spread across different values. 
This could tell us whether most movies have similar durations or if there's a wide range.

**Overall, this is a glimpse into the patterns of movie lengths in the dataset, combining both numerical insights and a <span style="color:green;">visual representation</span> for a more comprehensive understanding.**
